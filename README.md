# Coding 101 with Alec

Curated programming resources!

- [Codecademy: Learn How to Code](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-how-to-code) - this is an amazing resource that walks you through the high level concepts with exercises and visuals.
- [Basics of Programming](https://github.com/alecchendev/cs-101-by-alec/tree/main/basics) (in this repository!) - because Codecademy's Python courses cost money, Kaggle's intro course is a little too complex, and code.org's courses are too abstracted, I've created a lightweight introduction to programming in Python that I believe should be more engaging and easy (largely based on Kaggle's course).
    - I've included a project at the end that is meant to help the transition from completing exercises to actually building something!
- [Kaggle's Python Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) - Python has much more to offer! Learn more Python with this course, which will help you become more comfortable with programming when exploring further.
- [Coding Bat](https://codingbat.com/python) - exercises for if you want to strengthen your fundamentals.
- Beyond Basics - resources if you'd like to continue to explore the world of programming!
    The following sections are separated by topics in computer science.
    - Data science and machine learning
        - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) - lots of great courses to explore data science and machine learning, and they're all free!
    - Web development
        - [Mozilla's Getting started with the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) - great general introduction to making your first basic website.
- Project Ideas
    - Web application! Flask! Platform to share links.
    - Data analysis! Get a cool dataset and make visualizations and write an article!
    - ML Model! Make a twitter bot to tweet like someone you know using a language model. Maybe even just make it respond to prompts based off of someone's tweets.
