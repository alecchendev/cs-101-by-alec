# Basics of Programming For People with Short Attention Spans

Not going to explain everything. Just going to show things, and have you engage with things. Often tutorials make you do a lot of reading which gets boring. We're here to code not read!

### Topics
- Variables
    - printing
    - arithmetic
    - comments
    - variables
    - changing variables
    - multiple variables
    - exercises
        - uncomment something
        - print something
        - declare and add to a variable
        - calculate something given a bunch of variables
- Data types
    - integers
    - floats
    - strings
    - booleans
    - type conversions
    - exercises
        - identify types of each thing
        - what happens after this type conversion?
- Operators
    - we've seen operators for numbers but
    - += for numbers
    - +, +=, * for strings
    - ==, !=, >, <, >=, not for booleans
    - exercises
        - write something to update a number
        - given these strings, create this output
        - evaluate these boolean expressions
- Functions
    - function that does something, no args
    - function that returns something no args
    - function that has args
    - variable scope
    - exercises
        - define a function that does this simple thing
        - call the function
        - define a function that takes in this, outputs this
        - define a more complex function that uses prev function
- Conditionals
    - use functions in these examples
    - conditions are something that evaluates to boolean
    - if statements
    - if else
    - if elif else
    - multiple elif
    - exercises
        - given conditional, set these variables so that it outputs this
        - given variables, create conditional (in a function) so that it outputs this
- Loops
    - while
    - for
    - range...
    - exercises
        - create a while loop that does this
        - change it to a for loop
        - create a function that uses loops and conditionals - print out every odd number (provide %)
        - create a nested loop with a conditional or something - show composability
- Lists
    - lists are collections
    - len
    - [] access elements
    - for i in list
    - in operator
    - \+ operator
    - append
    - pop
    - strings are like lists accept for the adding and popping part
    - exercises
        - iterate through and print elements (for i in range) - access elements
        - change to a for each loop
        - access the first half of this list
        - switch the second and first half of this list
        - iterate through this list, create new list with names that start with "A"
        - given two lists, get the elements that are in both
- Bonus: User input
    - input function
    - that's it
    - exercises
        - print length of person's input
        - function to get input, then conditional and loop

### Format of each topic/module
- Many examples + output

- Several exercises starting very easy and increasing in difficulty

### Final Project
- Terminal application! Wordle/hangman! (create skeleton, break into sections, write tests)

## Installation
- Visual Studio Code
    - Extensions: jupyter notebook
